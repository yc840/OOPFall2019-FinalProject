We changed some of the requirements because we realized that we couldn't implement, 
or that we have already asked for it/ had no meaning. We tried our best on this project. The most we could do was import a .csv file, 
calculate the total, and then export it to a new file. 

The requirement that we found impossible to figure out was:

add/remove an item  to/from the .csv file. 

The choosepayment and paycredit requirements had no meaning because storing the 16 digit card number that we were asking for 
was going to be stored for no reason.
